    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      Hello and welcome — I’m glad you’re here. My name is Jessica and I work at the intersection of law, technology and responsible AI. As a legal professional (LL.M.) with a background in business economics, I bring more than ten years of experience in the life sciences industry, where I worked in highly regulated and complex matrix organisations with a strong hands-on mentality. Along the way, I discovered my passion for backend engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my experience, the most challenging task is finding the right balance between regulation and innovation. My heart truly beats for both sides: on the one hand, I understand the realities of business, transformation and operational delivery from many years inside global industry environments. On the other hand, I am deeply motivated by building clear, reliable governance frameworks that follow legal and ethical principles and create trust in technology.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe my core strength lies in bridging these worlds. Today, I focus on (technical) AI governance, EU AI Act implementation, ISO 42001 and the development of practical compliance structures that make AI systems trustworthy, transparent and aligned with regulation in real business environments.
