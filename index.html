      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hello and welcome — I’m glad you’re here. My name is Jessica, and I work at the intersection of law, business
        operations, and technology. With over 10 years of experience in the highly regulated Life Sciences industry
        at Bayer AG, I gained deep insight into how large organizations manage compliance, risk, and innovation at scale.

        Working in this environment highlighted for me how the rapid rise of AI is reshaping established governance
        approaches. As organizations move toward automated and data-driven decision-making, compliance increasingly
        becomes a technical as well as a legal and operational challenge. This realization led me to make a
        strategic transition from Global Strategic Sourcing to Technical AI Governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my experience, the most challenging task is finding the right balance
        between regulation and innovation. I specialize in the implementation of the EU AI Act and ISO 42001, but with
        a unique technical twist. As a legal professional (LL.M.) who is also a Backend Engineer,
        I don't just interpret regulation—I architect it.
      </p>

       <p>
        Why this matters for today’s enterprise challenges:
        The biggest hurdle for companies isn't understanding the law; it's operationalizing it without killing innovation.
        My dual expertise allows me to:
        </p>

        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implement Technical Human Oversight</li>
          <li>Balance Regulation & Agility</li>
          <li>Bridge the Communication Gap: I act as the bilingual translator between legal departments, technologists, and C-level stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        My heart beats for building reliable, transparent, and legally sound AI frameworks that create deep trust in technology while maintaining the operational speed a company needs to compete.
